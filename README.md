# advertiser test app
List of things that should be improved
1. integrate http service and retreive mock data from network
2. add @media queries for mobile users
3. code clean up still needed

Lodash is not needed here, everything was coded with pure javascript ES6.
Because last year I spent working with react/redux this tiny app was created using same approach :)
